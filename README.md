# Typing Assistant

The Typing Assistant is a C++ program designed to provide typing predictions to enhance your typing experience. It displays up to four word suggestions based on the characters you enter, allowing you to select one of the suggestions or continue typing your desired word. The program intelligently prioritizes suggestions based on usage statistics, ensuring the most frequently used words are displayed first. Additionally, the program registers and learns new words as you type.
